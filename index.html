<p><b>Abstract</b>: A research report on how encouraging children to elaborate to identify comprehension and semantic association with content in the book alters their responses. Methods used include asking children questions of varying difficulty and evaluating their responses.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b>:This research project was primarily focused on the language use of children of an early age, and how it varies under pressure and in different context. Subsystems of language - primarily phonetics, was used as a way to discuss and evaluate the language. The language of the children was sorted into different categories based on what they were responses to, and the qualities (mostly prosodic features) were observed, and thus, a conclusion on how the language of children varied based on the stress and difficulty level of questions asked was formed.</p>

<h2>Influences on Language and Data Collection</h2>

<section>
<p>During the language acquisition fieldwork, the group communicated with the children in order to collect information about their skills pertaining to certain language subsystems such as morphology, phonetics and syntax. The language used had a phatic and referential function, primarily – by reading stories to the children, the group aimed to teach and consolidate cognitive skills, and establish a connection with the children. At times the language was conative, as the children often misbehaved and needed to be instructed on what to do. The intent of the language was to build rapport with the children, while also maintaining a level of social distance, because of the age difference and other facts about the context about the situation. The register used was not entirely formal or informal – the group had to appear as professional but also friendly, as the children needed to be encouraged to engage. However, it was important not to overstep boundaries. As there were three different group members the language used varied between these people, but it was over all consistent. The most important factor to the tenor is age. The children were 4-5 years and the group members were 16-17. This means that the group members held more responsibility as they had more influence and power over the children. Thus, the group had to use negative face to establish social distance in order to not overstep boundaries. However, the children and group members also had things in common such as being students and going to the same school, which the older members recognized, but it is unclear whether the younger children would have made the connection. As said before, the audience was very young, and small - a group of three, with varied cultural backgrounds. However, they were all at a similar level of English and presumedly have lived in the country for a similar amount of time. Some semantic fields were reading, education, and ones specific to the content in the books such as animals, colours, trucks, construction, witches, magic and fantasy. The communication was spoken and spontaneous. On cultural context; due to the age of the younger participants they have not had the time (or the mental capacity) to form complex beliefs and ideologies. They did though have opinions and beliefs on personal matters such as favorite colour and animal (eg. One child liked yellow, another liked green). They did not argue about which was better or more correct but held it to be a personal matter. On the beliefs of the group members, attitudes towards discipline were displayed.</p>

<h2>Fieldwork Research Question and Methodology</h2>

<section>
<p>The investigation aims to find how encouraging children to elaborate to identify comprehension and semantic association with content in the book alters their responses. More broadly, we aim to find how children’s responses change when under pressure (such as being asked a harder question, or being asked to elaborate) compared with an easy one. We aim to use a mixed methodology, by asking questions and allowing the children to answer and then to observe the qualities of their speech. There should also be enough variety to ensure that quantitative data, such as how many words the children answers in, can also be observed. We aim to describe the variations in the children’s speech in terms of phonetics, phonology, lexicology and semantics. Our question does not directly aim to prove or disprove any theory of child language acquisition, but our research can be used in such a way. It is vital that our research complies with ethics. The privacy of the children is respected, as they will not be named, no photos or videos of them will be collected, and only a voie recording which will be deleted later will be taken. It is also key for us researchers to treat the children with respect, to understand and respect their boundaries and ensure that they are not put in danger. We aim to engage in unifying and diplomatic conversation, although due to the nature of the question, we may need to be somewhat secretive about the nature of the activity should the children ask.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<section>
<p>The data we collected was mostly qualitative data. Line 2, in which Child 1 says “Frog!” demonstrates one type of response given – short, quick and excited. The question asked was personal and simple, suggesting that such a response is given for questions that are not challenging for the child. In line 3, one of the group members asked for the children to sit down. More proof of this is given in line 6 – when the children are asked to answer a question, Child 3 preemptively exclaims " [that's] easy for me!", using the same manner of utterance as for when Child 1 exclaimed "Frog!". In line 7, group member P is about to ask for Child 3 to let the other children speak. In line 8, Child 3 once again interrupts, in order to demonstrate his comprehension. It can be noted that (most likely due to his age) he is not entirely phonetically developed (he replaces the "l" sound in "blue" and "black" with "w"). However, it can be seen that he is able to identify certain concepts (signified) and their relation to words and pictures (signifier). He then asks a question of his own, in line 9 - "Why's it the same colour as the page?" Group member P does not answer the question, but instead responds with "yeah" (line 10), implying that the question Child 3 asked was phatic in nature, not meant to be answered but to be an acknowledgement of an absurdity that the communicators can connect over. However, this may not have been Child 3's intention, implying a disconnect between the communicators, possibly due to the difference in age. Group member P asks another question, "what colour's the page?". Child 3's answer (line 11) now takes on a different manner – the vowel in "white" is elongated, and he uses a downward inflection. Because the question was unexpected, this may suggest that an elongated and downward inflected response is characteristic of a less sure answer. This can be supported further by when the Child 3 says "I don't know" (line 15), similarly with a downward inflection. An elongated vowel can also be seen in questions the children ask (line 46) when Child 1 is asked to stop doing something, he asks "why?" With an elongated vowel – showing further that when the children are unsure and are lacking in knowledge (either to a question they are being asked, or being unsure about why something is being asked of them) they will speak with a downward inflection and/or elongated vowel. It should be noted however that the children also use a downward inflection when answering an easy question (line 55).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<section>
<p>This study aimed to find how encouraging children to elaborate to identify comprehension and semantic association with content in the book alters their detail in responses. In order to answer this question, we asked the children different questions from easy to hard, and recorded their responses. It was found that there were two main types of responses the children would give. One (lines 2, 6, 18, 20, 21, 31, 32, 48, 59, 63) was given when asked an easy, exciting and relevant (personal to the child) question. They were often quick, and did not involve an elongation of a vowel (besides line 40), and ended in an exclamation. The number of words uttered were also from 1-3 words usually (probably due to the questions being simple, only a few words are needed to answer). The second category (lines 11, 15, 46, 65) were given when asked a harder, less personally relevant or unexpected question. They involved elongation of a vowel and/or a downward inflection. It can be concluded that it is likely that there is a correlation between easy questions and short, exclamatory responses, and hard questions with elongation of a vowel and a downward inflection.</p>
